# SQL-Analysis-of-Netflix-s-Global-Content-Library-
Analyzed Netflix's Movies &amp; TV Shows dataset using SQL to uncover trends in content distribution, ratings, and creator involvement, providing insights into content strategy, regional trends, and user viewing patterns.

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Netflix’s Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover trends in global content distribution, audience ratings, creator involvement, and keyword-based classifications. Using SQL as the primary analytical tool, the project aims to deliver meaningful insights into how Netflix structures, releases, and manages its vast content library.

The analysis includes exploring content types, identifying the most common ratings, extracting country-wise and genre-wise patterns, and studying content distribution over the years. In addition, the project answers 15 business questions such as longest movies, director-specific content, actor-based appearances, Indian content trends, and keyword-tagged classifications using optimized SQL queries.
The final outcome is a well-structured SQL analysis that supports insights into content strategy, regional production trends, catalog expansion, and user viewing patterns, helping stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions.
